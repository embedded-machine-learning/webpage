The 2023ACM/IEEE TinyML Design Contest at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) is a challenging, multi-month, research and development competition, focusing on real-world problems that require the implementation of machine learning algorithms on low-end microprocessors/microcontrollers. It is open to multi-person teams world-wide.
The team, consisting of Daniel Schnöll and Dominik Dallinger, have worked extremely hard the last months to develop a top solution, enthusiastically supported by the whole EML CD-Lab with creative ideas and vigorous encouragement. For their effort and ingenuity they are rightly acknowledged to be among the best in this comptetitive field. <b>Congratulations!</b>
