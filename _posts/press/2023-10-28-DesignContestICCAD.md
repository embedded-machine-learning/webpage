The team from the Embedded Machine Learning CD-Lab at ICT has reached the top 3 final round in ICCAD‘s TinyML Design Contest. In two weeks at the conference the winner will be announced.

The 2023ACM/IEEE TinyML Design Contest at ICCAD is a challenging, multi-month, research and development competition, focusing on real-world problems that require the implementation of machine learning algorithms on low-end microprocessors/microcontrollers. It is open to multi-person teams world-wide.

The top three teams are invited to the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) to present their solutions, and to recieve their awards.
The team, consisting of Daniel Schnöll and Dominik Dallinger, have worked extremely hard the last months to develop a top solution, enthusiastically supported by the whole EML CD-Lab with creative ideas and vigorous encouragement. For their effort and ingenuity they are rightly acknowledged to be among the best in this comptetitive field. <b>Congratulations!</b>

Daniel Schnöll and Dominik Dallinger will travel to San Francisco to represent the team and TU Wien at ICCAD, taking place in Oct 29 - Nov 2. <b>Good Luck!</b>
