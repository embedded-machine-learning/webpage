As part of the activities in embedded machine learning, a group of 6 people from the Institute of Computer Technology including 5 employees of the CDL EML participated at the Evergreen Innovation Camp 2022, an event for students and young professionals targeting autonomous technologies for wood industry. Within 48 hours the participants were given the task to come up with their own vision of an "autonomous woodworker" and present their application and solution at the final pitch event.
