Multispectral Feature Fusion for Deep Object Detection on Embedded NVIDIA Platforms

In this work, we studied the impact of multispectral feature fusion approaches in deep Neural Networks for object detection in embedded NVIDIA devices. Our focus was on designs that can be implemented without a lot of design effort.

This paper was accepted at the DATE 2023 conference, 17-19 April 2023, Antwerp, BE.
Link to the paper coming soon.
