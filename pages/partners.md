The Christian Doppler Research Association (CDG) is named after the Austrian physicist and mathematician, Christian Andreas Doppler. He is primarily renowned for his discovery known as the "Doppler Effect". The universality of the "Doppler Effect" applies to a wide spectrum of uses in natural sciences and technology.
<br>
The non-profit association aims at promoting development in the areas of natural sciences, technology and economy as well as for their economic implementation and utilisation. It enables talented scientists in renowned research centres to achieve high-quality research and knowledge transfer in line with the demands and to the advantage of the CDG member companies.<br>
The aim of the Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW) is to drive the positive development of the business location further, to actively use the opportunities of digitization for economy and society and to promote entrepreneurship.
