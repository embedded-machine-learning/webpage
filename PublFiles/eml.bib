  abstract	= {Improving the capabilities of embedded devices and
		  accelerators for Deep Neural Networks (DNN) leads to a
		  shift from cloud to edge computing. Especially for
		  battery-powered systems, intelligent energy management is
		  critical. In this work, we provide a measurement base for
		  power estimation on NVIDIA Jetson devices. We analyze the
		  effects of different CPU and GPU settings on power
		  consumption, latency, and energy for complete DNNs as well
		  as for individual layers. Furthermore, we provide optimal
		  settings for minimal power and energy consumption for an
		  NVIDIA Jetson Nano.},
