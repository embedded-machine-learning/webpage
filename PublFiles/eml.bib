  abstract =	 {In this article, we make the case for the new class
                  of Self-aware Cyber-physical Systems. By bringing
                  together the two established fields of
                  cyber-physical systems and self-aware computing, we
                  aim at creating systems with strongly increased yet
                  managed autonomy, which is a main requirement for
                  many emerging and future applications and
                  technologies. Self-aware cyber-physical systems are
                  situated in a physical environment and constrained
                  in their resources, and they understand their own
                  state and environment and, based on that
                  understanding, are able to make decisions
                  autonomously at runtime in a self-explanatory
                  way. In an attempt to lay out a research agenda, we
                  bring up and elaborate on five key challenges for
                  future self-aware cyber-physical systems: (i) How
                  can we build resource-sensitive yet self-aware
                  systems? (ii) How to acknowledge situatedness and
                  subjectivity? (iii) What are effective
                  infrastructures for implementing self-awareness
                  processes? (iv) How can we verify self-aware
                  cyber-physical systems and, in particular, which
                  guarantees can we give? (v) What novel development
                  processes will be required to engineer self-aware
                  cyber-physical systems? We review each of these
                  challenges in some detail and emphasize that
                  addressing all of them requires the system to make a
                  comprehensive assessment of the situation and a
                  continual introspection of its own state to sensibly
                  balance diverse requirements, constraints,
                  short-term and long-term objectives. Throughout, we
                  draw on three examples of cyber-physical systems
                  that may benefit from self-awareness: a
                  multi-processor system-on-chip, a Mars rover, and an
                  implanted insulin pump. These three very different
                  systems nevertheless have similar characteristics:
                  limited resources, complex unforeseeable
                  environmental dynamics, high expectations on their
                  reliability, and substantial levels of risk
                  associated with malfunctioning. Using these
                  examples, we discuss the potential role of
                  self-awareness in both highly complex and rather
                  more simple systems, and as a main conclusion we
                  highlight the need for research on above listed
                  topics.},

  abstract	= {We investigate the potential of recurrent neural networks
		  (RNNs) to improve traditional on-line multi-target tracking
		  of traffic participants from an ego-vehicle perspective. To
		  this end, we build a modular tracking framework, based on
		  interacting multiple models (IMM) and unscented Kalman
		  filters (UKF). Following the tracking-by-detection
		  paradigm, we leverage geometric target properties provided
		  by publicly available 3D object detectors. We then train
		  and integrate two RNNs: A state pre-diction network
		  replaces hand-crafted motion mod-els in our filters and a
		  data association network finds detection-to-track
		  assignment probabilities. In our extensive evaluation on
		  the publicly available KITTI dataset we show that our
		  trained models achieve competitive results and are
		  significantly more robust in the case of unreliable object
		  defection.},
