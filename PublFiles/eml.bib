  abstract	= {In this article, we make the case for the new class of
		  Self-aware Cyber-physical Systems. By bringing together the
		  two established fields of cyber-physical systems and
		  self-aware computing, we aim at creating systems with
		  strongly increased yet managed autonomy, which is a main
		  requirement for many emerging and future applications and
		  technologies. Self-aware cyber-physical systems are
		  situated in a physical environment and constrained in their
		  resources, and they understand their own state and
		  environment and, based on that understanding, are able to
		  make decisions autonomously at runtime in a
		  self-explanatory way. In an attempt to lay out a research
		  agenda, we bring up and elaborate on five key challenges
		  for future self-aware cyber-physical systems: (i) How can
		  we build resource-sensitive yet self-aware systems? (ii)
		  How to acknowledge situatedness and subjectivity? (iii)
		  What are effective infrastructures for implementing
		  self-awareness processes? (iv) How can we verify self-aware
		  cyber-physical systems and, in particular, which guarantees
		  can we give? (v) What novel development processes will be
		  required to engineer self-aware cyber-physical systems? We
		  review each of these challenges in some detail and
		  emphasize that addressing all of them requires the system
		  to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation and a
		  continual introspection of its own state to sensibly
		  balance diverse requirements, constraints, short-term and
		  long-term objectives. Throughout, we draw on three examples
		  of cyber-physical systems that may benefit from
		  self-awareness: a multi-processor system-on-chip, a Mars
		  rover, and an implanted insulin pump. These three very
		  different systems nevertheless have similar
		  characteristics: limited resources, complex unforeseeable
		  environmental dynamics, high expectations on their
		  reliability, and substantial levels of risk associated with
		  malfunctioning. Using these examples, we discuss the
		  potential role of self-awareness in both highly complex and
		  rather more simple systems, and as a main conclusion we
		  highlight the need for research on above listed topics.},

  abstract	= {We investigate the potential of recurrent neural networks

		  of traffic participants from an ego-vehicle perspective. To
		  this end, we build a modular tracking framework, based on
		  interacting multiple models (IMM) and unscented Kalman
		  filters (UKF). Following the tracking-by-detection
		  paradigm, we leverage geometric target properties provided
		  by publicly available 3D object detectors. We then train
		  and integrate two RNNs: A state pre-diction network
		  replaces hand-crafted motion mod-els in our filters and a
		  data association network finds detection-to-track
		  assignment probabilities. In our extensive evaluation on
		  the publicly available KITTI dataset we show that our
