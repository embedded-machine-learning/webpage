  abstract	= {In this article, we make the case for the new class of
		  Self-aware Cyber-physical Systems. By bringing together the
		  two established fields of cyber-physical systems and
		  self-aware computing, we aim at creating systems with
		  strongly increased yet managed autonomy, which is a main
		  requirement for many emerging and future applications and
		  technologies. Self-aware cyber-physical systems are
		  situated in a physical environment and constrained in their
		  resources, and they understand their own state and
		  environment and, based on that understanding, are able to
		  make decisions autonomously at runtime in a
		  self-explanatory way. In an attempt to lay out a research
		  agenda, we bring up and elaborate on five key challenges
		  for future self-aware cyber-physical systems: (i) How can
		  we build resource-sensitive yet self-aware systems? (ii)
		  How to acknowledge situatedness and subjectivity? (iii)
		  What are effective infrastructures for implementing
		  self-awareness processes? (iv) How can we verify self-aware
		  cyber-physical systems and, in particular, which guarantees
		  can we give? (v) What novel development processes will be
		  required to engineer self-aware cyber-physical systems? We
		  review each of these challenges in some detail and
		  emphasize that addressing all of them requires the system
		  to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation and a
		  continual introspection of its own state to sensibly
		  balance diverse requirements, constraints, short-term and
		  long-term objectives. Throughout, we draw on three examples
		  of cyber-physical systems that may benefit from
		  self-awareness: a multi-processor system-on-chip, a Mars
		  rover, and an implanted insulin pump. These three very
		  different systems nevertheless have similar
		  characteristics: limited resources, complex unforeseeable
		  environmental dynamics, high expectations on their
		  reliability, and substantial levels of risk associated with
		  malfunctioning. Using these examples, we discuss the
		  potential role of self-awareness in both highly complex and
		  rather more simple systems, and as a main conclusion we
		  highlight the need for research on above listed topics.},

  abstract	= {We investigate the potential of recurrent neural networks
		  (RNNs) to improve traditional on-line multi-target tracking
		  of traffic participants from an ego-vehicle perspective. To
		  this end, we build a modular tracking framework, based on
		  interacting multiple models (IMM) and unscented Kalman
		  filters (UKF). Following the tracking-by-detection
		  paradigm, we leverage geometric target properties provided
		  by publicly available 3D object detectors. We then train
		  and integrate two RNNs: A state pre-diction network
		  replaces hand-crafted motion mod-els in our filters and a
		  data association network finds detection-to-track
		  assignment probabilities. In our extensive evaluation on
		  the publicly available KITTI dataset we show that our
		  trained models achieve competitive results and are
		  significantly more robust in the case of unreliable object
		  defection.},
