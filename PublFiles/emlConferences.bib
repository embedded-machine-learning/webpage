  title = {Towards Data-driven Multi-target Tracking for Autonomous
		  Driving},
  abstract = {We investigate the potential of recurrent neural networks
		  (RNNs) to improve traditional on-line multi-target tracking
		  of traffic participants from an ego-vehicle perspective. To
		  this end, we build a modular tracking framework, based on
		  interacting multiple models (IMM) and unscented Kalman
		  filters (UKF). Following the tracking-by-detection
		  paradigm, we leverage geometric target properties provided
		  by publicly available 3D object detectors. We then train
		  and integrate two RNNs: A state pre-diction network
		  replaces hand-crafted motion mod-els in our filters and a
		  data association network finds detection-to-track
		  assignment probabilities. In our extensive evaluation on
		  the publicly available KITTI dataset we show that our
		  trained models achieve competitive results and are
		  significantly more robust in the case of unreliable object
		  defection.},

		  searches across datasets of different sizes as well as
		  machine learning algorithms. Further, we propose a method
